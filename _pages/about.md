Currently finishing my undergraduate degree studying computer science at PMU. Expected to graduates May/June 2024.

I am an enthusiast and a fanatic about the field of AI. After finishing an internship as a researh assistnat, i have continued to independently learn about the vast world of AI technology.

Since the best way to learn is by doing, i have gone on to build several passion projects. My best one winning a [TensorFlow Community Award](https://twitter.com/TensorFlow/status/1616147733903024129). Another project turned into a full fledged [research topic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00757).

Looking to persue a graduate program after comleting BCs. Intrested to go on to research the current state-of-art systems and try and push the boundries of what computers can do.
