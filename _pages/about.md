Currently finishing my undergraduate degree studying computer science at PMU. Expected to graduates May/June 2024.

I am enthusiastic and a fanatic about the field of AI. After finishing an internship as a researh assistnat, i have continued to independently learn about the vast world of and AI technology.

Since the best way to learn is by doing, i have gone on to build several passion projects (My best one winning a TensorFlow Community Award). One project turned into a full fledged research topic.

Looking to persue a graduate program after comleting BCs.
