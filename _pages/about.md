I am currently completing my undergraduate degree in computer science at PMU, with an expected graduation date of May/June 2024.

Driven by curiosity, I once landed an internship as a research assistant, which sparked my fascination and fueled my independent exploration of the vast world of AI technology.

Recognizing that hands-on experience is the best way to learn, I have undertaken several passion projects, one of which earned me a [TensorFlow Community Spotlight Award](https://twitter.com/TensorFlow/status/1616147733903024129). Additionally, another project evolved into a full-fledged [research topic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00757).

Motivated by my passion for research and development, I am eagerly preparing to pursue a graduate program upon completing my Bachelor's degree. My ultimate goal is to immerse myself in cutting-edge research on state-of-the-art systems, continuously pushing the boundaries of what computers can achieve.
