    Demo of Lem using Ray Perception

<p>This project involved working with the Unity game engine, specifically the ML-Agents package. The main focus of this project was to acquire proficiency in the Unity game engine and to develop an engaging application of Reinforcement Learning.
</p>

Lem (the camel) was taught using two methods, Ray Perseption (similar to LiDAR), and Vision.

<p>Since the maximum award the agent can get is 1. When the Mean Reward reached 0.96 it is expected that the agent has fully learnt the task.
