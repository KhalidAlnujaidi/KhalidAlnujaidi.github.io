<p>This project involved working with the Unity game engine, specifically the ML-Agents package. The main focus of this project was to acquire proficiency in the Unity game engine and to develop an engaging application of Reinforcement Learning.

Lem (the camel) was taught using two methods, Ray Perseption (similar to LiDAR), and Vision.
