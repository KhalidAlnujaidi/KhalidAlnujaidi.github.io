This project was based on developing a ring that could initially serve as a tutor to help visually impaired individuals learn to read the Braille language.

The device is a 3D pritned right that hold a RasberyPi along with camera and speaker. 

How the tutor system works is by having an individual point thier finger at printed Braille and tap the ring to capture an image, that then image is processed through ML and the approriate speech corrisponding to the Braille is read out.
