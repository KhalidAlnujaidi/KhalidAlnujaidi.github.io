<p>
Passion project that came to be after struggling to train my first custom image classifier. At that time of the project i had just completed my research internship at PMU and was new to machine learning. 
</p>
<p>
The project took about 3 months of on-and-off work, and it helped me learn a lot, mostly about the thought process of envisioning something, documenting its desired functionality/appearance, and the necessity of gradual incremental development. 
</p>
<p>
This was all before ChatGPT, so the project involved a loot of reading library documents and browsing Stack Overflow :face_exhaling: :joy:
</p>

Technology used for this project was:
- Threading. First real world case of seeing it being required. 
- PyQt5 for the UI. This was a great [crouse](https://www.udemy.com/course/pyqt5-from-a-z/) that helped
- TensorFlow for all the ML related work
