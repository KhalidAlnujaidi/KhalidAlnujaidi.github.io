Live Detection of Camels through a web browser UI developed using Flask and a custom trained Yolov5 model.

This project helped me learn the difference between classification and detection. My intrest in computer vision greatly increase through this project. 

Technology used for this project was:
- Python's Flask library for the UI. 
- Custom trained Yolov5 model

The app and model weight can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/KhalidAlnujaidi/Spot-The-Camel-App) 

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khalidalnujaidi/images-of-camels-annotated-for-object-detection)
