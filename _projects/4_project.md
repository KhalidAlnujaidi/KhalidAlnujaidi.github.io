This was first research project that i worked on. It was during my internship at RoboLab @ PMU under the supervision of Dr. Ghazanfar Latif.

The process of conducting this research project was as following:

- Go to local farm and gather data samples
- Capture images with Nikon D3100 camera
- Preprocess images using python [[The custom script used]](https://github.com/KhalidAlnujaidi/Region-of-interest-Extractor)
- Feature extraction & conventional ML experiments
- Deep learning experiments

    </div>

        <p>The project was a nice introduction to the field of machine learning. Prior to this, the only CS classes I had completed were Intro to CS 1 & 2. Tackling something like this was quite challenging; however, the learning experience was exceptional</p>
