<p>This was first research project that i worked on. It was during my internship at RoboLab @ PMU under the supervision of Dr. Ghazanfar Latif.
</p>
The process of conducting this research project was as following:

- Go to local farm and gather data samples
- Capture images with Nikon D3100 camera
- Preprocess images using python [[The custom script used]](https://github.com/KhalidAlnujaidi/Region-of-interest-Extractor)
- Feature extraction & conventional ML experiments
- Deep learning experiments


<p>The project provided a valuable introduction to the field of machine learning, helping me solidify my understanding of the scientific method. It taught me the importance of investing time and patience when tackling what at first apear as complex ideas and new technologies.</p>
